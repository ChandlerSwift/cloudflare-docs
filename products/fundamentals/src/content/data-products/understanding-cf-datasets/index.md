# Understanding Cloudflare's Datasets

Almost every Cloudflare product retains a small amount of information about the traffic, activity, and events it detects. How we gather and display this information varies depending on the product.

WAF
DNS
Workers
Radar
Network Analytics - Provides near real-time visibility into network- and transport-layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks. Network Analytics visualizes packet and bit-level data, which is also available via the GraphQL Analytics API (Enterprise plan only). 
Web Analytics - Provides privacy-first analytics for your website without changing your DNS or using Cloudflareâ€™s proxy. You can use Web Analytics independently from other Cloudflare products.

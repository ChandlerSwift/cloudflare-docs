# Cloudflare's Data Products

Cloudflare offers several ways to access the metadata generated by our products.

<ul><li>Analytics - Review aggregated metrics for all sites in your account as well as extensive site-level information about attack and mitigation activity detected by Firewall, load balancer steering decisions, threat and event data, and more. Use the analytics available on the Cloudflare dashboard to better understand what Cloudflare is doing behind the scenes.</li>
<li>Logs - Access detailed logs of HTTP requests, Spectrum events, or Firewall events and combine that information with logs from other sources, like your application server. Use Logs when you want the flexibility of customizing how you visualize the log data.</li>
<li>Alerting - Receive notifications when information you care about is detected by Cloudflare. With Alerts, you can configure what notifications are flagged and only pay attention to the activity you care about. </li></ul>
